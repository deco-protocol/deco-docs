overview
deco protocol instances are designed and deployed for yield tokens and their protocols to generate fixed-yield assets

Users are able to purchase tokens (ERC20 or NFTs) that can be redeemed later with the promised fixed-yield

Traders can bet on future yield by purchasing tokens that earn the yield generated by the yield token. 

Developers can integrate Deco with any yield token to bring this feature to your ecosystem.
